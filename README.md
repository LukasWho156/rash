# Rash

A super simple "browser" that allows you to play [itch.io](https://itch.io)
web games without showing the entire page. The point of this tool is to make
video recording for these games easier.

## Usage

To load a new game, simply enter the game's itch.io URL into the text field and
hit the "Go!" button.

To load a previously loaded game, click its link in the lower section of the
home page. Note that this is preferrable to loading the game again, as the HTML
of the game page doesn't have to be parsed a second time.

Press F10 at any time to return to the home page. Press F11 at any time to
toggle fullscreen mode.
